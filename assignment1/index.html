	<h3>All About Me</h3>

	<img src="images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Katrina Prather's picture" id="me">
	
	<p>My first interest in technology came about once I decided to major in Computer Information Systems. After college, I started out in the desktop support arena, moved to teaching Computer Science classes and on to benefit coding in the IT Healthcare industry. It is with pleasure to announce that my next transition in the IT world is to become a Front-End Web Developer! In college, I had an internship with the Webmaster at my university. It's interesting to fast forward to the present and now be interested in making that transition career wise. I am super excited about this journey!  Lending a helping hand to develop some websites for a few non-profits will be one of the joys of my new endeavor.</p>

	<p>As a current IT professional, I've created several tools that have created efficiency for my team and the customer. I consistently utilize analytical, organizational and detail-oriented skills. I posses an above and beyond drive and I'm ready to work for amazing company with a great group of developers. </p>
	<p>Outside of work, I enjoy learning, sports, technology and real estate to name a few things. So, I'm pretty much always on my laptop. I'm a coffee addict. Therefore, I definitely enjoy hanging out with my laptop in coffee shops and bookstores. Atlanta is my home away from home because I'm always around town after work for a variety of things including the aforementioned interests. Who knows - I just may end up meeting a few amazing people and we start a profitable business together.</p>
